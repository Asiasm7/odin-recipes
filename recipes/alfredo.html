<h4> Description </h4> 
<p> To make seafood alfredo, start by preparing the seafood of your choice, such as shrimp, scallops, or a mix of seafood, by cleaning and seasoning it with salt, pepper, and a touch of garlic. In a large pan, melt butter over medium heat and sauté the seafood until it's cooked through and tender, then set it aside. In the same pan, add more butter and minced garlic, cooking until fragrant. Pour in heavy cream, stirring occasionally, and bring it to a simmer. Gradually add grated Parmesan cheese, stirring constantly until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Add cooked pasta, such as fettuccine, to the sauce and toss to coat. Finally, gently fold in the cooked seafood, ensuring everything is well combined. Serve hot, garnished with chopped parsley and extra Parmesan.</p>

<h4> Description </h4>
<p> To make baked French toast, grease a baking dish and arrange thick slices of bread (like challah or brioche) in a single layer. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, heavy cream, sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of cinnamon, then pour this custard over the bread, ensuring it’s fully soaked. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight. When ready, preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), uncover the dish, and optionally sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon. Bake for 35-45 minutes until the top is golden and the custard is set. Serve warm with syrup, berries, or whipped cream.</p>
<h4> Ingredients </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 loaf of bread (challah, brioche, or French bread)</li>
      <li>6 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)</li>
      <li>Butter or cooking spray (for greasing the baking dish)</li>

      <li>Additional cinnamon (optional, for topping)</li>
    </ul>
<h4> Steps </h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a baking dish with butter or cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Slice a loaf of bread (such as challah or brioche) into thick slices and arrange them in a single layer in the baking dish, slightly overlapping if necessary.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together 6 large eggs, 2 cups milk, ½ cup heavy cream, ½ cup granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional).</li>
    <li>Pour the custard mixture evenly over the bread slices, ensuring each piece is well-soaked.</li>
    <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate for at least a few hours or overnight to allow the bread to absorb the custard.</li>
    <li>Remove the cover and, if desired, sprinkle the top with a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon for added sweetness and crunch.</li>
    <li>Bake the French toast in the preheated oven for 35-45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the custard is set.</li>
